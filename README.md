**Hi, I'm Jonathon,**

I'm a student at The University of Adelaide in my final year, studying Software Engineering.

This GitHub account is mainly used for University-related projects. I have also been working on and contributing to a number of open source projects here on GitHub.
My personal work can be found on my [other GitHub account](https://github.com/tallbl0nde).

I have a strong interest in programming in lower-level languages (mainly C and C++), as well as higher-level languages such as Java and C#. That being said, programming a
website using the Ruby on Rails framework has also been a highlight of my time at University.
